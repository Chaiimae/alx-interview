Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which each entry is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The topmost row of the triangle starts with a single number 1. Subsequent rows are formed by adding pairs of numbers from the row above, with the edges of the triangle filled with 1s.

The triangle is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, though it was studied by mathematicians in India, Persia, China, and Italy long before his time. It has many applications in mathematics, including combinatorics, algebra, and probability.

Key Properties:

Symmetry: The triangle is symmetric.
Binomial Coefficients: The 
ùëõ
nth row corresponds to the coefficients of the expansion of 
(
ùëé
+
ùëè
)
ùëõ
(a+b) 
n
 .
Each row starts and ends with 1: This is because there is only one way to choose all or none from a set


example: 
       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
Each number is the sum of the two directly above it. For example, in the third row, 2 is obtained by adding the two 1s above it.

Pascal's Triangle is a simple yet powerful tool for understanding patterns and solving various mathematical problems.

Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Here‚Äôs a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

Recursion:

Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
Recursion in Python (Real Python)
Queue and Stack:

Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
